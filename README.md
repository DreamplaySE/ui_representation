# ui_representation
This project solves a very specific problem I had while developing an app of mine, namely, how do I represent dynamic data on the frontend, with premade structs from the backend. This project is the solution. It creates proc-macros that creates methods to the derived struct with metadata about how to visualize the data, as well as a system for how to dynamically modify it.
